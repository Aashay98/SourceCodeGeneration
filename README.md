What Purpose Project Solve?
Our project provides Developers a option to make Web pages for performing CRUD operations by providing code to them from the input which we take as field name and field type name and can run on their own system.

How Project Works?
It uses Alexa to get input from the user such as project name, modules and forms, then generate the code as per the input and store the code  in AmazonS3 then the code generated is mailed to the user on their registered email. Then the user can run the code on his system in Eclipse IDE by using his database.
